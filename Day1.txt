Day 1:
==>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
---------It is effort to automate the intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.
---------Can computers think? questioned by the scientist created the term AI.
---------It is simply the set of predefined rules eg.,tic-tac-toe game,chess.These are not 
working by itself,human has written tons of lines of code beforehand for the game to execute.
---------Machine learning is a subset of AI.
---------ML comes into play when the data's are given the rules ie., it has the capbility 
to analyse the data and produce the result.

CLASSICAL PROGRAMMING:
---------Data and rules produces result.

MACHINE LEARNIG PROGRAMMING:
---------Data and result produces rules.This is the reason that we do not get high accuracy.
---------So this becomes our goal to create a ML model that makes fewer mistakes.
---------Rather than finding the rules for the program it is finding the rules by the algorithm.

NEURAL NETWORK:
---------Subset of ML
---------It is a form oof ML that uses layered representation of data.(multi-stage information
extraction process.)

Note:
---------Data is a important part in ML,NN,AI

Input information:
---------The information that we always have and give it to the models to get some output called features.
---------It is used to make prediction.
Example:
Mid-term 1 and final results are know.therfore they would be the input information ie features.
Our task is to find the performance of mid-term 2 based on mid-term 1 and final result.So here,
mid-term 2 is called as labels.
